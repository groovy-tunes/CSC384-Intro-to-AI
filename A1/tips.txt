1. box can be in various different state, and you need to consider that.
	box can be at storage, pushable in 1 to 4 directions, unpushable but not at storage, etc.

2. For A*, if you heuristic is not very good, you can still prune states base on gval.


3. If a initial state cannot be solved in time, it would probably because that the search
is in a looping state, i.e. the robot is moving up and down or left and right, the state is not 
progressing anymore, thus the it exceed the time limit. One way to solve this issue is that
improving your heuristic funciton, and another way can be doing more cycle checking 
(i.e. elliminating same states using hashing)


4. (Extra one)The way of search could be more efficient. You could start the searching from
the storage to each boxes and eliminate the cells that the boxes can never go to 
(i.e. corners and some cells that the box cannot be pushed to the storage from that cell).
